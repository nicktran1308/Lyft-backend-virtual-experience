# Project Overview

This repository contains my work and learnings from the Forage Lyft Virtual Experience. The virtual experience focused on developing clean and efficient code for future configurations, understanding UML diagrams, and showcasing sample backend work.


## 1. Clean & Efficient Code

I learned how to write clean and efficient code that is scalable and adaptable for future configurations. This includes best practices for structuring code, optimizing performance, and writing maintainable code.

## 2. UML Diagram

I gained an understanding of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams and their importance in software development. I learned how to create UML diagrams to visualize the structure and behavior of a system, helping in the design and implementation phases of a project.

## 3. Sample Backend Work

Work on backend tasks and projects.

## 4. Refactoring

I learned techniques for improving code readability, maintainability, and performance without altering its external behavior.

## 5. Software Architecture

Basic principles and patterns

## 6. Unit Testing

Writing effective tests for ensuring software component correctness and reliability.

Throughout this virtual experience, I was able to develop practical skills and knowledge that are valuable for my future career in software development and engineering.
