# Forage Lyft Virtual Experience

This repository contains my work and learnings from the Forage Lyft Virtual Experience. The virtual experience focused on developing clean and efficient code for future configurations, understanding UML diagrams, and showcasing sample backend work.

## What I Learned

During the Forage Lyft Virtual Experience, I gained the following key learnings:

1. **Clean & Efficient Code**: I learned how to write clean and efficient code that is scalable and adaptable for future configurations. This includes best practices for structuring code, optimizing performance, and writing maintainable code.

2. **UML Diagram**: I gained an understanding of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams and their importance in software development. I learned how to create UML diagrams to visualize the structure and behavior of a system, helping in the design and implementation phases of a project.

3. **Sample Backend Work**: Through this virtual experience, I had the opportunity to work on backend tasks and projects. I was able to apply my knowledge of backend development and work on sample projects that showcased my skills in this area.
